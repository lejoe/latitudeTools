h2. Description

This is a set of tool to Record your google latitude in a DB
and get it back with a KML with all the positions.

h2. Installation

# git clone git://github.com/copernic67/latitudeTools.git
# move _config.php to config.php and edit it with your own values
# Use _DB.sql to create the needed database
# Use a cronjob to call latitude2DB.php as many times as you want
# calling DB2KML.php will get you a KML file with all the pois in the DB
    DB2KML.php will display the positions of the current day
    DB2KML.php?dstart=YYYY-MM-DD will display the positions of that day
    DB2KML.php?dstart=YYYY-MM-DD&dend=YYYY-MM-DD will display the position of the days in that interval

h2. TODO

* Fix the encoding issues (reversedLocation are wrong in the DB)
* Remove the multiple points in the KML when it comes from the same point and the same timestamp
    Eventually replace then the timestamps by timespans: http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kmlreference.html#timespan
